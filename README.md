# basketball-shot-predict
University project for classes named "Programming of Photonics Devices".
Main concept was to predict ball movement by polynominal regresion. On each frame we find and save (X, Y) coordinates of ball center and draw two lines:
  - predicted one
  - normal route
 During the program's operation the user is informed in real time if the ball falls into the basket.
 Sample recordings are also attached
